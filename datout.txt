A picture of army vehicles.
If you think that there is an end to these interface-born lifeworlds, then you are mistaken..
.
Something else is there represented as particles floating in a dark space..
Faces flashed across thousands of screens..
Categorized, commodified, bombarded..
Constructed and deconstructed..
Something else to be released..
And again, reconfigured..
.
What about the physical perception of the self?.
Are we still bodies?.
Can we still breathe?.
Divided individuals.
endlessly torn subjects..
What about attitudes and behaviours?.
Trying to disappear..
Completely..
.
I have observed myself, .
you know, .
seeing myself from many different perspectives..
The relation between myself and the world I am in .
is different to the world I saw from other perspectives/before. .
It is a rupture..
I can only grasp it from the pictures that someone else has given me..
.
Imprisoned in a video surveillance set-up,.
I can observe the world through the lenses of others. .
Observe individual actions.I can construct my viewpoint from other viewpoints,seeing reality from fragmented perspectives and abstractions..
.
If you are looking for me.
you should look closer..
Scrambling.
Cutting.
Editing.
Blurring.
Masking.
Erasing..
We are exposed. .
Who can see us all? I can see the world from my vantage point. All the other viewpoints— are seen through my perspective. It is a phase.  A moment of being lost,  of losing oneself. In the midst of a crisis In the midst of a reconfiguration. You can touch,  You can see You can sense will it help to kill the one, who hypnotizes you? The hypothesis of a hidden reality behind the constraint of an interface..
.
I can look through the monitor and see emptiness. .
A dark chamber, .
the interior of a black box. The thing that used to be me..
.
You have been tracked as an intelligence asset, .
an international crime figure,.
an innocent woman, .
a mere piece of information, .
an act of resistance, .
an informant, .
a source of tension, .
a fresh target, .
a voice of protest..
I can imagine that someone is constantly.
watching over us. .
Unfortunately, it is..
I can imagine that someone is wondering who we are..
Unfortunately, it is..
Busy, the watcher..
For some, the anxiety becomes charming..
You know you've been spotted..
Tell me whatever .
You might hope to find out..
.
It's always been difficult.
to understand how your knowledge of me.
increases the way I become invisible..
The more you know me, the less there is..
.
My ego expanded. .
I felt you better..
You are so beautiful to me. You are the truth. .
You are everything.You are the thing I need to be. I can't let you go. I have to live. .
I don't want to be a commodity..
Though, I guess there is no way out..
I'm the product and the consumer..
I'm the human and the non-human..
I'm the input and the output..
I'm just someone, who needs to be saved..
.
But, I still have one last request:I ask you; stop surrendering to others..
.
The illusion of an interface affects my ability to experience. My face has softened. I am no longer a member of the human species. I have become an assemblage of cryptic information..
.
What does it mean when the body is no longer a liberated object? .
What does it mean when the body is transformed into a controlled object of technology?.
We are not human.We are not the same..
You are not the same.You are no longer the same. .
You are no longer a person or a human being. .
You are an object of overwhelming control, of selected behaviours..
Your emotions no longer have agency. You are an electronic spam filter, shipped to your front door, silently violating the cloud..
Sacred, just a new-age brand.
like personal philosophy;.
and everywhere we’re being scanned.
in perfect cattle mimicry..
.
How much are we willing to give up?.
What are the functions that are unnecessary?.
.
Just in case you thought you'd ask.
now you know..
